# Sales Forecasting Optimization

A comprehensive solution for sales forecasting and optimization using AI and machine learning. This project includes data preprocessing, trend analysis, predictive models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost), and optimization techniques to enhance decision-making, inventory management, and demand planning.

## 📋 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Multiple forecasting models:
  - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - XGBoost
- Feature engineering and selection
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Interactive visualizations
- Seasonal decomposition and trend analysis
- Performance metrics and reporting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sales-Forecasting-Optimization.git
cd Sales-Forecasting-Optimization
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Data Preparation:
```bash
python src/data/prepare_data.py
```

2. Model Training:
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

3. Generate Forecasts:
```bash
python src/models/predict.py
```

4. For interactive analysis, launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📈 Model Performance

The project implements multiple models and compares their performance using metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

## 🔍 Features Used in Forecasting

- Historical sales data
- Seasonality patterns
- Price variations
- Regional factors
- Product categories
- Special events/holidays
- Economic indicators
